Introduction
============

This is a simple demo of the
[ROS navigation "stack"](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation) running on the
[KUKA youBot](http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/service_robotics/research_education/youbot/).
The demo uses a
[Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01](http://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/02sensor/07scanner/download/products/urg-04lx-ug01/)
laser scanner and the [hokuyo_node](http://wiki.ros.org/hokuyo_node) ROS package
for obtaining laser scan data used in detecting obstacles. The demo uses the
[eband_local_planner](http://wiki.ros.org/eband_local_planner) for a local
planner, and the
[youbot_driver_ros_interface](https://github.com/youbot/youbot_driver_ros_interface)
for controlling the youBot and providing odometry information.
